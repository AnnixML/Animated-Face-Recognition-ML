# Animated-Face-Recognition-ML

This Repo contains the Machine Learning Model used in our Animated Face Recognition project

@ https://github.com/MatthewSigit/Animated-Face-Recognition

as well as programs used to train it (and previous iterations). If you are here to view the CS307 project, please view the other repo, as it contains relevant documents and code for the front-end and back-end.
